A high level interface and object model for the Notion SDK.  This is loosely modeled
after concepts found in [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org) and
[MongoEngine](http://mongoengine.org).  Built on the excellent
[notion-sdk-py](https://github.com/ramnes/notion-sdk-py) library, this module provides
higher-level access to the API.

That being said, if you do use this library, please
[drop me a message](https://github.com/jheddings/notional/discussions)!

## Installation ##

Install the most recent release using PyPi:

```shell
pip install notional
```

*Note:* it is recommended to use a virtual environment (`venv`) for installing libraries
to prevent conflicting dependency versions.

## Usage ##

Connect to the API using an integration token or an OAuth access token:

```python
import notional

notion = notional.connect(auth=AUTH_TOKEN)

# ¡¡ fun & profit !!
```

## Contributing ##

I built this module so that I could interact with Notion in a way that made sense to
me.  Hopefully, others will find it useful.  If someone is particularly passionate about
this area, I would be happy to consider other maintainers or contributors.

Any pull requests or other submissions are welcome.  As most open source projects go, this
is a side project.  Large submissions will take time to review for acceptance, so breaking
them into smaller pieces is always preferred.  Thanks in advance!
