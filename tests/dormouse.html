    <h1>Mad Tea Party</h1>

    <!-- Some special block types... -->

    <blockquote>
        There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare
        and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast
        asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it,
        and talking over its head. "Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse," thought Alice;
        "only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."
    </blockquote>

    <pre>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner
  of it: "No room! No room!" they cried out when they saw Alice coming. "There's
  <i>plenty</i> of room!" said Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair
at one end of the table.</pre>
